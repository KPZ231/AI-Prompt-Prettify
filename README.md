## Application Description

**AI Prompt Prettify** is a desktop application created by KPZsProductions that allows you to enhance prompts (commands) for AI models such as Google Gemini. Thanks to its intuitive user interface, the application enables quick and convenient improvement of prompt quality, resulting in better and more precise responses generated by artificial intelligence.

The application uses the Gemini API, automatically detects and saves the API key, and offers a range of features to make working with prompts easier every day.

## Features

- **AI prompt enhancement** – automatic improvement and expansion of commands for AI models.
- **User-friendly graphical interface** – application based on Tkinter with a modern look.
- **Clipboard support** – quickly paste and copy text.
- **API key configuration** – easy input and saving of the Gemini API key.
- **Hotkey** – global hotkey `Ctrl+Alt+P` for quick window show/hide.
- **Automatic copying of enhanced prompt** – after enhancement, the prompt is immediately in the clipboard.
- **Progress bar** – information about the ongoing enhancement process.
- **Multilingual support** – the application preserves the original prompt language.
